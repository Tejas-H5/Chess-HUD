# Chess HUD (Try it [here](https://tejas-h5.github.io/Chess-HUD/chess.html))

An idea for a chess setup where you can see exactly what is happening at the current moment at all times.
Mainly to reduce one move blunders and to see the consequences of one of your moves before you finish your turn.

## Known bugs / issues:

- Can castle out of check
- Doubled pieces, i.e rook behind a rook on the same file, should give two attacks/supports to everything on that file, but this is not happening yet
